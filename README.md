# AI-ChatBot-
AI ChatBot using Deep Learning and NLP in Pytorch

This project aims to develop an AI ChatBot for an e-Commerce website that sells coffee and tea. The dataset was collected in the form of a JSON file containing questions and responses for different categories like- greeting, payment, goodbye, order, etc. The input questions were converted into features using the Bag of words technique and trained to give the categories as the output prediction using a Feed-Forward Neural Network. Once the final predicted label is obtained signifying the category or the context of the question we randonly choose responses from the given category to reply to the customer.
